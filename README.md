In this academic project for the "Artificial Intelligence" course, I built and trained a neural network to perform image classification on the large CIFAR-10 dataset. The model was successfully optimized to achieve an accuracy of over 80% on the test set.

In this project I created an AI application to assist language learners by offering real-time pronunciation checking and speech translation. It was built using Azure AI Foundry for the implementation of speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech translation across multiple languages

For this project I built an emotion recognition system using a dual-approach: deepFace for quick implementation and a custom deep neural network (TensorFlow/FER-2013). The system includes a live demo via OpenCV to classify emotions in real-time from webcam feed
